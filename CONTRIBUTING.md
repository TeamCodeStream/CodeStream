# Contributing

## What contributions are accepted?

In short, we are open to nearly all contributions! We love feedback in all forms, issues, comments, PRs, etc!

Unless you feel confident your change will be accepted (trivial bug fixes, code cleanup, etc) you should first create an issue to discuss your change with us. This lets us all discuss the design and proposed implementation of your change, which helps ensure your time is well spent and that your contribution will be accepted.

## All contributions will be goverened by the Apache 2.0 Software License

When you contribute code changes, your contributed code is understood to be under the same [Apache 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) that covers our project. Feel free to contact us if you have any questions or concerns about this.
